        Sightread is great for beginners – you can play songs without needing to learn sheet music.
        Sightread creates an intuitive <span className="italic">Falling Notes</span> visualization
        of a song, similar to rhythm games like Guitar Hero.

      <p>
        For those who want to learn sheet music, Sightread offers{' '}
        <span className="italic">Sheet Hero (beta)</span> mode. Sheet Hero is a halfway point
        between the simplicity of falling notes and the full complexity of sheet music. Notes are
        laid out on a musical staff, but timing is simplified. Sheet Hero represents the duration of
        notes with a tail instead of beat denominations. Key signatures are also optional in this
        mode. Sightread will by default display a song in it’s original key, but you may change the
        key to any that you prefer.

      <p>
        When initially learning a song, we recommend learning left and right hands separately. You
        should also take advantage of the BPM modifier to slow down a song by at least 50%. It is
        significantly more helpful to hit the right notes with good form and slowly build up speed
        than to frantically practice at full speed and build bad habits. This is especially true
        when combining hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you connect a MIDI keyboard, you can enable <span className="italic">Wait</span> mode –
        the song will wait for you to hit the right key before progressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sightread works best in conjunction with a Piano teacher. Falling notes will allow you to
        have more fun with less experience, but it is no replacement for formal education. Learning
        music theory will help you get a more holistic music experience than learning solely
        learning how to play songs.

      </p>
      <p>
        You can <AboutLink href="https://midishare.com/upload">upload</AboutLink> MIDI files to
        midishare where they’ll be available for the entire community. If you’d prefer to keep them
        local, you can also upload them directly to Sightread which saves them in browser storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can’t find the music you’re looking for on midishare, a Google search is your best
        bet. Or you can send me an <AboutLink href="mailto:sightreadllc@gmail.com">email</AboutLink>{' '}

        Sightread needs a keyboard with MIDI-out, usually via USB or Bluetooth. We recommend opting
        for USB connection because Sightread is latency-sensitive.
